# UOL-Projects
Collection of projects that I have done during my masters in 2019-2020 at University of London
### Visualise and describe the data via unsupervised learning methods
* Analyzed and visualized “European Working Conditions Survey” data by finding useful insights about individual emotions and job satisfaction levels using unsupervised learning. 
### Students' Grades Prediction
* Developed models to predict student’s grades using the "Student-POR and Student-MAT" dataset by applying supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, tree-based models
